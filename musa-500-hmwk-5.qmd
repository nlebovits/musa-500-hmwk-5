## Introduction

**1.	Describe the data set and indicate what the purpose of this assignment is. That is, how can k-means clustering help you look at the data, and what kinds of questions can you answer?**

```{r data and package import}

#install.packages(c("NbClust","flexclust"))

library(NbClust)
library(flexclust)

wine <- read.csv("wine.csv")

```



## Methods

**1.	How does the K-means algorithm work? Describe the steps in your own words.**

**2.	What are some of the limitations of the algorithm?**

**3.	What are some other clustering algorithms, and might they be more appropriate here?**


## Results

**1.	Present and describe the results from the NbClust command and the scree plot.** 
**a.	Whatâ€™s the optimal number of clusters that you should choose based on the output?**
